## BuddyPress Data Exporters

The next version of BuddyPress will contain new tools that will help BP-powered sites comply with data regulations like GDPR. If your site needs access to these tools before they're available in a BuddyPress release, you can use this plugin. 

When installed alongside WordPress 4.9.6+ and BuddyPress, this plugin will add BP-specific data to user exports generated at Dashboard > Tools > Export Personal Data.
